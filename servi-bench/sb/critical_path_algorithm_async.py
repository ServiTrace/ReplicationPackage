"""This file implements and explains the algorithm for
critical path extraction supporting asynchronous invocations.

Basic tests available under: tests/unit/critical_path_algorithm_async_test.py

This abstracted version demonstrates the generic and easier-to-understand
algorithm compared to the actual implementation used in the aws_trace_analyzer.py,
which is cluttered with implementation details supporting many special cases.
The unit tests under `tests/unit/aws_trace_analyzer_test.py` cover several cases
but the main testing is done through the integrated validations and
analysis of over 21 million traces.

    """Algorithm 1: Critical path extraction supporting asynchronous invocations.
    The line numbers and identical code from the paper are annotated for easy comparison.
    This algorithm is a modified version of the weighted longest-path algorithm
    proposed for microservices in OSDI'20: qiu:20: "FIRM: An Intelligent Fine-grained
    Resource Management Framework for SLO-Oriented Microservices."
    It addresses the three challenges (C1-C3) explained below.

    Algorithm description:
    This critical path algorithm adapted for supporting asynchronous invocation works by
    iteratively building the longest path (i.e., critical path) from
    the start of the trace (i.e., span with earliest startTime)
    to the end of the trace (i.e., span with latest endTime).
    It leverages recursion to follow into child spans under two conditions:
    a) For asynchronous calls, a child span is only followed
       if it is connected to the end of the trace.
    b) For synchronous calls, a child span is only followed
       if there is not already a longer asynchronous call present.
    These two conditions are easy to check using the auxillary stack S.

    Challenges (C) and solutions (=>):
    * C1: Wrong order of child spans in original version
      * => Fixed in updated version of the algorithm by moving Line 8 in qiu:20 to after Line 13.
           Line 8 `path.append(...)` produced a wrong order within child spans in critical path.
           Moving this line after the for loop (i.e., after line 13) fixed this issue..
    * C2: Asynchronous invocation cannot be detected reliably from traces
      * => H1: Heuristic1 detects obvious async invocations.
           Limitation: Cannot detect an asynchronous invocation that ends before its parent
           (same case as Sync1 in Fig. 4 in the ServiTrace paper).
      * => Conditional recursion with checks whether the child span is connected
           to the end of the trace clarifies which of potentially many async child spans to follow.
    * C3: Timing in fine-grained traces
      * a) different services can report timestamps in different resolutions (e.g., ms vs ¬µs)
      * b) insufficient timestamp resolution for consecutive fine-grained spans leads to spans
           with a duration of 0 milliseconds (ms).
      * c) clock shifts can occur in large-scale distributed systems with timestamps originating
           from many different serverless services.
      * => H2: Heuristic2 fixes the order of 0-ms trace span when adjacent to >0-ms span by
               using the startTime as secondary sort key when primarily sorting by endTime.
            Limitation: Cannot detect two consecutive 0-ms spans.
      * => H3: Heuristic3 implements time comparisons using a margin ùõÜ when comparing timestamps.
               For example: t1 < t2 can be implemented as 0 < t2 - t1 + ùõÜ
               The AWS implementation also considers the topological trace information, which takes
               precedence.

    Input:
    S: stack with all parent spans of the span with the latest endTime from
        a serverless execution trace T with span attributes startTime, endTime, and childSpans.
        Such a stack can be obtained by following the parent relationships from the end to the start
        of the trace. This pre-processing can potentially be done during trace correlation.
    currentSpan: currently active span (default: start of trace defined by earliest startTime).

    Output:
    List of critical path from the start to the end of the trace.
